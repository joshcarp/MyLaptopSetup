# My Laptop Setup

Just personal laptop setup, only works for mac

Feel free to fork, modify, and use it.

To use:
1. run `setup.sh`, which will install brew, xcode cli, zsh, and oh-my-zsh. It also setups golang directories and git configs, modify them to your needs.
2. run `install.sh`, which will install the rest of the applications. Modify the last two lines of it because it downloads my `.zshrc` and `.vimrc`.

It's very small, it installs
* [Homebrew](brew.sh)
* brew-cask
* wget
* docker
* virtualbox
* adoptopenJDK 8 (java 8)
